# Protein-Docking
Small/ Might be useful scripts solving bioinformatic problems
The swiss-model structure simulation create a folder with several levels, with the pdb file in the deepest layer, and all the pdb files are named as 
model-0*.pdb. For batch docking of pdb files, they need to be extracted from folders described above and have a unique rename principle. It is suggested 
to name ur project clearly when submitting ur sequence to swiss-model, and this script can help u to rename ur pdb files based on ur project name.
